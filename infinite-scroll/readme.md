Loading images from ~~Unsplash~~ Lorem Picsum in an infinite scrolling page.

Check it alive here: <https://meleu.github.io/js-practice/infinite-scroll>

## Things I Learned

### loading.io

Cool page to generate nice and funny loading images: <https://loading.io/>


### Unsplash API / Lorem Picsum

The <https://unsplash.com> is a site to get free nice photos.

You can get photos data from unsplash API. Check the documentation at <https://unsplash.com/documentation>.

**Note**: the unsplash API requires an API Key to get the images via API. So, in order to share this project and make it alive via github-pages, I decided to use Lorem Picsum: <https://picsum.photos/> (no API key needed).


### DOM events

Reference: <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp>

Used for infinite scrolling:

- `scroll` - occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled.

- `load` - occurs when an object has loaded.


### Heights in the DOM

- `window.innerHeight` - total height of browser window.

- `document.body.offsetHeight` - height of everything in the body element (including what is not withing the current viewport).
